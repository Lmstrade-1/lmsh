          <p>
            I carry out careful, conservation-led work on mechanical watches, focusing on methodical inspection,
            controlled servicing, and sympathetic restoration. The aim is always dependable function and respectful
            preservation of original character.

        <h2>Typical service workflow</h2>
        <p>
          Each piece is treated on its own merits, but a structured, best-practice service approach generally includes:
        </p>

        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Initial assessment, functional checks, and visual inspection of case and movement condition</li>
          <li>Photographic documentation before work begins</li>
          <li>Careful disassembly using appropriate supports and controlled handling</li>
          <li>Cleaning of components using suitable processes for oils, residues, and contamination</li>
          <li>Inspection for wear, corrosion, damage, or prior incorrect intervention</li>
          <li>Rectification or replacement of worn parts where feasible and appropriate</li>
          <li>Correct lubrication in the correct locations, using appropriate oils and greases</li>
          <li>Reassembly and staged functional testing throughout</li>
          <li>Regulation and performance checks across positions where relevant</li>
          <li>Final observation period, basic verification of stability, and completion notes</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
          Vintage watches vary widely. Outcomes and timeframes depend on condition, parts availability, and prior history.

        <div class="two-col">
          <div>
            <p>
              Restoration work is approached conservatively, with an emphasis on preserving original geometry, surface
              character, and legibility. Where appropriate, case work can include cleaning, controlled preparation,
              and refinishing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preparation may include chemical cleaning and surface preparation steps designed to remove contaminants
              and provide a stable base for finishing processes, applied with care and with attention to compatibility
              of materials and coatings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finishing may include case polishing and refinishing, and where suitable, electroplating as part of a
              conservation-led restoration approach.
