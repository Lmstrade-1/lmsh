          <p>
            I carry out conservation led servicing and restoration of vintage mechanical
            timepieces, with a focus on careful handling, clean working practices, and
            controlled processes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Work is approached methodically, with attention to the condition, originality,
            and long term serviceability of each piece. Interventions are kept proportionate
            and sympathetic, with the aim of preserving function while respecting the
            character and history of the watch.
          </p>

          <p>
            Work is undertaken by appointment only.

  <section>
    <h2>Servicing and Conservation</h2>

    <p>
      Each watch is assessed on its own merits, with a structured service approach followed
      to ensure alignment with recognised best practice and conservation principles. The
      precise scope of work is guided by condition, construction, and prior history. Typical
      service activities include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initial visual inspection and functional assessment of the watch in its received condition</li>
      <li>Documentation of condition prior to any intervention</li>
      <li>Careful disassembly using appropriate supports and controlled handling</li>
      <li>Cleaning of components to remove aged lubricants, residues, and contamination</li>
      <li>Inspection for wear, corrosion, damage, or evidence of prior incorrect work</li>
      <li>Rectification of issues where feasible and appropriate, with replacement limited to necessity</li>
      <li>Correct lubrication applied in the correct locations using high quality synthetic lubricants appropriate to the movement design</li>
      <li>Treatment of key components and jewels with Episurf-Neo surface treatment to control oil spread, improve stability, and support consistent performance over extended service intervals</li>
      <li>Reassembly with staged functional checks throughout</li>
      <li>Regulation and performance observation appropriate to the age, construction, and intended use of the movement</li>
      <li>Final observation period and completion notes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Photographic records and short video clips are captured during key stages of the service
      process, providing a clear and traceable record of condition, intervention, and completion.

  <!-- Case and Movement Restoration -->

        <h2>Case and movement restoration</h2>

        <p>
          Restoration work is guided by a conservation led philosophy, with careful
          consideration given to originality, material condition, and historical character.
          Where patina is stable and contributes positively to the appearance and integrity
          of a piece, it is retained. Intervention is reserved for cases where deterioration
          progresses beyond a desirable or stable vintage condition and begins to compromise
          function, protection, or long term preservation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Case work includes controlled cleaning, surface preparation, and refinishing where
          appropriate. Chemical preparation processes are employed selectively to remove
          contaminants, corrosion products, or degraded surface layers, and to establish a
          stable and compatible base for subsequent finishing or protective treatments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where finishes have failed and base metals are exposed, appropriate electroplating
          is employed as part of a considered restoration strategy. Electroplating may be
          applied to cases and, where appropriate, selected movement components, with processes
          chosen to ensure material compatibility, controlled thickness, and long term durability,
          while remaining sympathetic to the original construction and appearance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finishing techniques are selected to suit the original design intent and condition
          of each component. These may include high polishing, fine satin or brushed finishes,
          matt finishing, starburst finishing, and other period appropriate surface treatments.
          Particular care is taken to preserve original geometry, edge definition, and surface
          transitions, avoiding unnecessary removal of material.
        </p>

        <p>
          Movement restoration may also include stabilisation or cosmetic correction of selected
          components where this supports long term function, legibility, or protection. Such
          work is undertaken only where it can be achieved without compromising originality,
          serviceability, or future maintenance.

  <!-- How I Work -->
  <section>
    <h2>How I work</h2>

    <p>
      Work is undertaken by appointment only and accepted on a selective basis, ensuring that
      sufficient time and care can be given to each piece. The approach is deliberately measured
      and avoids production line practices, favouring careful, methodical work carried out at an
      appropriate pace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each watch passes through a distinct inspection and assessment phase. No quotation is
      provided at the outset. Following inspection, findings are communicated and the proposed
      approach is discussed in close consultation with the client, with decisions guided by
      condition, construction, and long term serviceability rather than by default scope or
      cosmetic preference. Only once this stage is complete is work scheduled and progressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Processes are carried out in a controlled working environment, with attention paid to
      cleanliness, correct tooling, and repeatability. Decisions on repair, restoration, or
      stabilisation are made with future maintenance in mind, avoiding unnecessary alteration
      or irreversible intervention, and maintaining a preference for proportionate and
      sympathetic treatment throughout.
